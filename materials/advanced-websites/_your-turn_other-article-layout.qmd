1. Add an image that spans across the whole page

2. Add some text to the margin

**Advice**:

- Don't try to make all these changes at once! Remember the workflow: edit, save, preview, repeat. 
- Use the documentation at [Quarto.org \> Guide \> Authoring \> Article Layout](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html).

To follow along with the course exercises, you'll need Quarto version 1.8+ and access to a code editor that supports R.

While Quarto itself doesn't require a programming language, the exercises will include code chunks in R. If you don’t already have R set up locally, I recommend using a cloud-based option like Posit Cloud.

## Recommended setup options

### Option 1: Posit Cloud (RStudio in the cloud)

- Create a free account at <https://posit.cloud/>
- Join the Posit Cloud workspace: <https://posit.cloud/spaces/704423/join?access_code=fDGrujjY7mb1j-9bq-dlKl7JZw5XkLdq5sm3cFoE>
- Click "Yes" to join the space.
- Click Content and select `quarto-websites-exercises_2025-10` or go to `LINK FORTHCOMING`
- To save a copy of the project to your workspace, click "Save a permanent copy".

### Option 2: Local installation

## Accessing the course materials

If you are using a cloud-based option, the files will be included in the project folder.

If you are not using a cloud-based option:

**If you don’t use Git/GitHub:**

- Go to the GitHub repo: `LINK FORTHCOMING`
- Click the green "Code" button → "Download ZIP".
- Unzip the folder and open it in your chosen editor.

**If you use Git/GitHub:**

- Exercises are available at: `LINK FORTHCOMING`
- Clone the repository with Git:

```bash
git clone LINK FORTHCOMING
```

## Install the necessary R packages

If you are using Posit Cloud, the packages will be pre-installed. 

If you are using RStudio or Positron locally, install all the packages we'll use with:

```{.r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "quarto", "patchwork", "ggridges", "tinytable"))
install.packages('brand.yml', repos = c('https://posit-dev.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

To follow along with the course exercises, you'll need Quarto version 1.8+ and access to a code editor that supports R or Python.

While Quarto itself doesn't require a programming language, the exercises will include code chunks in R or Python. If you don’t already have R or Python set up locally, we recommend using a cloud-based option like Posit Cloud (for R) or GitHub Codespaces (for Python).

## Recommended setup options

## Accessing the course materials

If you are using a cloud-based option, the files will be included in the project folder.

If you are not using a cloud-based option:

**If you use Git/GitHub:**

- Exercises are available at: <https://github.com/posit-dev/quarto-brand-exercises/>
- Clone the repository with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/posit-dev/quarto-brand-exercises.git
```

**If you don’t use Git/GitHub:**

- Go to the GitHub repo: <https://github.com/posit-dev/quarto-brand-exercises/>
- Click the green "Code" button → "Download ZIP".
- Unzip the folder and open it in your chosen editor.

## Install the necessary R packages

If you are using Posit Cloud, the packages will be pre-installed. 

If you are using RStudio or Positron locally, install the packages on a Mac by running:

```r
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak(c("tidyverse", "quarto", "patchwork", "posit-dev/brand-yml/pkg-r"))
```

If you are using Windows, please run the below for the brand.yml package:

```r
install.packages('brand.yml', repos = c('https://posit-dev.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

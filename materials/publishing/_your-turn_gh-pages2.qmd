5. Change the `output-dir` option in `_quarto.yml` to `docs`.

   ```{.yaml code-line-numbers="false" filename="_quarto.yml"}
   project:
     type: website
     output-dir: docs
   ```

6. Add an empty file named `.nojekyll` to the root of your website project (this tells GitHub to not run its own static site generator).

7. Render your site.

8. Commit the newly created `docs/` folder and `.nojekyll` file and push to GitHub.

_sec_web-hosting-basics.qmd (stuff has to live on a server; when previewing, your computer creates a temporary server; domain names point at different servers)
_sec_hosting-options.qmd (easiest = quartopub (free) and Posit Connect (\$\$\$) ; medium = gh-pages and netlify ; advanced = GitHub Actions and DIY - gh-pages and netlify are a good sweet spot - quarto pub doesn't let you use custom domain names)

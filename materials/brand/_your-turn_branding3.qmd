1. In `01-exercise.qmd`, read in `_brand.yml` with `read_brand_yml()` from the {brand.yml} package. Store it as a variable named `brand`.

2. Change the color of the points to the brand's `blue` color and the line to the brand's `magenta` color. You'll use code that looks something like this:

   ```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
   geom_line(color = brand$color$palette$black)
   ```

3. **Bonus task!** Map a variable from the dataset to the color aesthetic and change the legend to use colors from the brand.

1. There is a file named `urban_institute.yml`. Make a copy of it, rename it to `_brand.yml`, and rerender your site. What changes?

2. Modify some of the variables in the `_brand.yml` file and rerender to see how your site changes. Explore [the brand.yml documentation](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/){target="_blank"} and see what other settings you can adjust.

   You can reset the file by copying and pasting it from [here](https://github.com/andrewheiss/quarto-websites-exercise-site_2025-10/blob/main/urban-institute.yml){target="_blank"}.

## Bring your own ideas!

::: {.incremental}
- The best way to learn is by building something
- I've given you playground code, but *it's not great* 
  - *This is by design!*
  - You're not learning a specific statistical method for a specific type of data; you're exploring the whole world of web design with Quarto
- You'll have time during the "Your turn"s to to play around and experiment. Try to use these new principles and skills to create something

## YAML-based page settings

Some page types are based on special templates that use information from the YAML metadata.

Two main built-in special page types:

- Listing pages
- About pages

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
(you can make your own special templates too!)
:::

## Listing pages

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

More about these in the advanced section!

## Background

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), also known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. Ada Lovelace is sometimes considered to be the first computer programmer.

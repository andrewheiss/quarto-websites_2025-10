1. Edit your `_quarto.yml` to make the following changes:

   - Change the preview port to 5555
   - Enable a cookie consent dialog
   - Add a site description

2. *Bonus tasks!*

   - Add a footer that says "Â© 2025, Myself"
   - Add an announcement bar that says something

**Advice**:

- Don't try to make all these changes at once! Remember the workflow: edit, save, preview, repeat. 
- Use the documentation at [Quarto.org \> Reference \> Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html)
